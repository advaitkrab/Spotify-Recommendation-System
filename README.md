# Spotify-Recommendation-System
This is a Spotify Recommendation System, an application made to aid users to discover and listen to new artists that have a similar style to what they already listen to.
Libraries required (IMPORTANT): plotly.io, warnings, pandas, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, tkinter
Users can choose to get recommendations based on their favourite artist or their mood at the time of using the application.
If selecting based on artist, there is a dropdown users can search from to select their favourite artist before selecting their favourite songs from that artist.
If selecting based on mood, there are sliders for each parameter of music that users can use to set the mood.
Generating recommendations provides the top ten matches to the users’ input.
These recommendations can be copied to the users’ clipboard to store elsewhere.
Special thanks to the following users on Kaggle:
•	@joebeachcapital for the Spotify API
•	@ziaadhosny for a guide on starting the backend code
